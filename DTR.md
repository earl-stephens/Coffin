# Coffin DTR

#	What are each of our learning goals for this project? What drives us in this project?
Learning goals: Practice with authentication via Oauth, Rails security best practices, consuming APIs, microservices/SOA/Sinatra.  Implement production quality user interface.  Optimization/database/caching.  Continuous Integration.
Drivers: Portfolio-level quality of project.  Fulfilling a real-world type of problem.
#	What is your collaboration style? How do you feel about pair programming vs. divide-and-conquer approaches?
Brian: Pair up front, then divide & conquer later on.
Earl: Pair up front, then divide & conquer later on.
Noah: Pair up front, then divide & conquer later on.
Ryan: Pair up front, then divide & conquer later on.
#	How do you communicate best? How do you appreciate receiving communication from others?
Brian: Direct feedback.  Kind/actionable.  Questions are a good way to approach a conversation.
Earl: Direct feedback.  Kind/actionable.
Noah: Direct feedback. Asking questions, open to learn.
Ryan: Direct feedback.  Questions, but kind/actionable when asking.
# How would you describe your work style?
Brian: More emphasis on pairing.  Works better afternoon/evening.
Earl: Good with both pairing and solo.  Start with pairing and then go solo later.  Afternoon/evenings are good.
Noah: Pairing if there’s an issue.  Communicate a lot.  Start with pairing and then go solo later.  Afternoon/evening.

# What are each of our strengths? How can our strengths complement each other?
Brian:  Clear, concise code.  TDD/edge case testing.  
Earl: TDD.  Staying on schedule.  Following Github projects.
Noah: BDD.  Debugging/following errors.
Ryan: Code logic.  Mediating team members.  Communicating.
Strengths complementing each other: Several members are strong in TDD, so that should help for those who aren’t.  Having someone good in Github projects will help keep the team on track, prevent scope creep.  Having a mediator will be helpful for solving any issues that come up.
#	What’s gone well or poorly in your previous projects?
Brian: Professional work environment/invested in the project.  Past projects have had all people working well together.  Communication and having DTR has helped keep everyone on the same page.
Earl: Had one project where project partner took over everything.  For the most part though, past projects have gone well.  Communication is a big part of success.
Noah:  Communication has been a determining factor in success/failure.  Communication about who is working on what has been helpful.  
Ryan:  Don’t assign anything you aren’t working on.  Had one project where project partner took on most of the work.  Communication is a big part of success.

Constant/frequent communication.  Patience.  Reaching out/asking for help.
#	What do you need (resources, environment, communication) to do your best work?
Brian: Coffee! Environment where it’s ok to ask for help when needed.  Do most work at Turing.  
Earl: Do most work at Turing, but can work elsewhere.  Open communication.
Noah: Do most work at Turing, but can work elsewhere. Environment where it’s ok to ask for help when needed.  
Ryan: Do most work at Turing.  Prefer more secluded/quiet spaces.
#	What scheduling restraints do you have? What are your scheduling preferences?
Brian: No restraints.  Hour commute each way.  Harder to come in earlier. Sunday afternoon will be unavailable.
Earl: No restraints.  If everybody is working in the evenings, then I’ll do practice work in the AM.
Noah: No restraints.  Can come in whenever.

#	What is your style for giving feedback? Does anything ever hold you back from giving feedback?

Ryan: Kind/specific/actionable.  Try to give suggestions.
#	What tools do you want to use to manage the project?
Github projects.  CircleCI.
#	How do you know if a project is successful? How can we achieve that as a group?
Meet MVP by the deadline.  Reach goal: placing in Demo Comp.  Use everything we have talked about.  
#	How will we recognize each other's successes and celebrate them?
High fives, fist bumps.
